This is the capstone project for Create Websites from Scratch, an HTML/CSS certification from Codecademy.

After submitting, I discovered my code is only responsive on the web browser.
Also, eventually realized I forgot to link bootstrap and that is why my change to the fixed header did not stick.
Also, favicon.
Improvements to come.
